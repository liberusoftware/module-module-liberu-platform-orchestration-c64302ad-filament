# Liberu Platform Orchestration · Laravel · Filament

Independent presentation module skeleton for **Liberu Platform Orchestration**. Intended boundary: php/composer laravel host with filament panels.

**Status: skeleton.** This repository supplies package/build structure and an explicit extension entry. It is not a completed feature, production API integration or registry publication. Existing implementations and package identities remain authoritative.

**Identity review required:** documentation records multiple source identities or a naming conflict for this capability. This skeleton keeps the exact source/plan key below distinct; it does not establish equivalence, a stable package contract or safe replacement of an existing implementation.

- Capability/source key: `liberusoftware/module-liberu-platform-orchestration`.
- Presentation scope: [Liberu Platform Orchestration](https://github.com/liberusoftware/documentation/blob/main/projects/accounting/filament/liberu-platform-orchestration.md).
- Canonical ownership record: [source/plan group](https://github.com/liberusoftware/documentation/blob/main/projects/accounting/nextjs/liberu-platform-orchestration.md).
- Registry identity: `liberusoftware/module-liberu-platform-orchestration-c64302ad-filament`.
- Foundation: [module-boilerplate-filament](https://github.com/liberusoftware/module-boilerplate-filament) at `9282e55622b1abd4db48da891480cd9cac46c158`.

## Develop and verify

```bash
composer install
composer validate --strict
composer check
```

The public entry is `Liberu\Presentation\Capability440ef19cd2e7\CapabilityPlugin::make()`, registered explicitly by the consuming Filament panel. It supplies the plugin lifecycle and a unique ID; no resources, pages or domain behavior are registered yet. Configure the reviewed Liberu installer in the host for the declared module package type.

Use the committed locks and declared toolchain. Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and the [presentation runbook](https://github.com/liberusoftware/documentation/blob/main/guides/presentation/README.md). Keep host routing, navigation, session integration and deployment outside reusable capability code. Keep Laravel policy, tenant context, validation, transactions, persistence and state transitions in the canonical owner. Do not infer endpoints or business DTOs from this registration descriptor.

Implement reviewed loading, empty, denied, invalid, stale/conflict, pending and recoverable failure states when adding real workflows. Test meaningful allowed/denied/wrong-tenant behavior against the authoritative API or public action. Reconcile uncertain writes before retrying and clear scoped cached data on logout. For device targets, review lifecycle, secure storage and platform support; a local draft is not a completed server transaction.

## Other presentations of this capability

The companion repositories use the same canonical scope and preserve their own presentation lifecycle. Availability is recorded by the repository inventory; a repository link is not evidence of an implemented feature.

## Release boundary

Build and inspect a packed artifact in a clean consumer before an authorized registry release. Keep prerelease/skeleton status until implemented behavior and supported runtimes are verified. Repository creation does not publish to Packagist, npm or pub.dev. Native signing and store distribution are separate application responsibilities.
